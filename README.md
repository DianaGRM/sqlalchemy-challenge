# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this repository is a folder "Resources" that contains the csv and the .sqlite data, also has the jupyter notebook for the analysis of the data and the python script for the app.

The jupyter notebook starts with importing all the necessary dependencies for this challenge, the first step is to control the connection to the database with "engine", After creating the engine I used "inspector" to be able to see the tables' names and columns. Used the Base to reflect the references to the classes, at the end "session" was created to use for query the data. In the analysis, I queried the data depending on what I wanted to see.
